This makes a table of contents as MDX components you can replace with the normal component object.

I have no idea how PR's will work and you may or may not have your changes credited, but who cares about the credit right?? :sweat: If you make a PR I will try to pull it into my monorepo in a way that credits you but no promises.


This requires [remark-pluck](https://github.com/liltechnomancer/remark-pluck) another small repo of mine. 
You can use this in a mono repo (I use turbo repo) or just download the project and change the includes.

Maybe one day I will make a tool for pulling all these into a mono-repo together, until then enjoy the legwork.
